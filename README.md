## SQL Exercises: Sakila Database

This repository contains a set of SQL exercises designed to help you practice and solidify your understanding of various SQL concepts and commands. 

The exercises utilize the Sakila sample database, which simulates a movie rental store.

**Concepts Covered:**

* **Basic Queries:** Selecting data, filtering with `WHERE`, using operators like `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and `REGEXP`.
* **Aggregate Functions:** Using functions like `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `SUM` to perform calculations on data.
* **String Functions:** Manipulating strings with functions like `CONCAT`.
* **Joins:** Combining data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`.
* **Self Joins:** Joining a table to itself to analyze relationships within the same table.
* **Subqueries:** Using nested queries to filter and refine results.
* **Date Functions:** Working with dates using functions like `DATEDIFF`.

**Exercises:**

The exercises cover a wide range of scenarios, including:

* Selecting specific data from tables (e.g., film titles, actor names).
* Filtering data based on various criteria (e.g., rating, length, release year).
* Calculating statistics (e.g., average film length, number of films per category).
* Joining tables to combine data (e.g., finding actors in specific films, counting rentals per category).
* Using subqueries to filter data based on complex conditions (e.g., finding actors who haven't been in horror films).
* Working with dates to calculate rental durations.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Set up the Sakila Database:** Download and install the Sakila database. Instructions can be found on the MySQL website.
2.  **Run the Queries:** Open the SQL file in MySQL Workbench and execute the queries.
3.  **Analyze the Results:** Examine the output of each query and compare it to the expected results.
4.  **Review the Comments:** Each query includes comments explaining the logic and the SQL concepts used.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exercises are designed to be progressively challenging, starting with basic queries and moving towards more complex scenarios.
* Feel free to modify the queries and experiment with different approaches.
* If you encounter any issues, refer to the MySQL documentation or online resources for assistance.

This set of exercises provides a comprehensive way to practice and improve your SQL skills. By working through them, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to query and manipulate data effectively.
